# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-0001: Extract, Do Not Greenfield

Status: Accepted

Sparkbot is the battle-tested source of truth. LIMA Runtime will be extracted from Sparkbot behavior with parity checks instead of rebuilt from a blank slate.

Consequence: Phase 0 creates contracts and docs only. Runtime behavior waits until contract review and extraction planning.

## ADR-0002: Guardian Is Mandatory Trust Boundary

Status: Accepted

Guardian is the syscall gate for every external action, tool execution, privileged operation, model call, robotics action, file/network/browser action, and approval-requiring operation.

Consequence: Guardian cannot be optional. Public Harness APIs cannot directly execute tools without Guardian classification and approval state.

## ADR-0003: MCP Is Driver/Tool/Plugin Boundary

Status: Accepted

MCP is used for external tools, drivers, Robo-OS, browser/filesystem/network adapters, plugins, and shell/runtime boundaries where useful.

Consequence: Internal Guardian, Harness, Spine, Storage, and policy contracts may use direct Python Protocols/ABCs. The internal kernel is not forced through MCP.

## ADR-0004: One Persistence Interface, Multiple Backends

Status: Accepted

Runtime persistence uses one contract with multiple backends: SQLite for local/desktop, Postgres for hosted, Memory/Vault backends, and future stores.

Consequence: Contracts store secret references, not raw secrets.

## ADR-0005: Tool-Pack Scoping Is Required

Status: Accepted

Shells declare allowed tool packs such as comms, robo, system, browser, files, memory, and admin.

Consequence: The Harness scopes tool catalogues per shell and request context. The model is not handed every available tool by default.

## ADR-0006: Sparkbot Remains The Parity Source

Status: Accepted

Sparkbot stays the current product shell and source of truth until LIMA Runtime parity is proven.

Consequence: Any extracted Guardian, Harness, Spine, driver, shell, or persistence behavior must be checked against Sparkbot behavior before Sparkbot is placed on top of LIMA Runtime.
