# LIMA-AI-OS

LIMA-AI-OS is the Phase 0 home for the **LIMA Runtime / LIMA Kernel**: a Guardian-gated agent and robotics runtime extracted from Sparkbot.

This is not a greenfield rewrite. Sparkbot is the battle-tested source of truth. LIMA-AI-OS starts with architecture, contracts, and package boundaries so SparkPit Labs can extract the runtime safely, preserve Sparkbot parity, and put every externally actionable operation behind Guardian.

Company context: [SparkPit Labs](https://sparkpitlabs.com).

## What This Repo Is

LIMA Runtime is the trust-gated operating layer that should eventually sit underneath:

- Sparkbot Desktop / Workstation
- LIMA Guardian Suite
- LIMA Robo-OS
- Arc / LIMA AI Office
- SparkPit web systems
- office automation bots
- humanoid robots
- worker robots
- future agentic and robotic operating systems

The long-term vision can be called an AI OS. The engineering surface is more concrete: runtime, kernel, contracts, trust gate, model harness, spine, drivers, shells, tool packs, and persistence interface.

## Phase 0 Status

**Phase 0 only. No runtime implementation yet.**

This repository currently contains:

- Architecture documents
- Extraction plan
- Public contract definitions
- Package skeleton
- Import-only tests

It does not contain migrated Sparkbot runtime behavior, live tool execution, production deployment wiring, credentials, real model calls, or robotics control paths.

## Core Invariant

Every external action, tool execution, privileged operation, model call, robotics or physical-world action, file/network/browser action, and approval-requiring operation must pass through Guardian.

**Guardian is the syscall gate.**

No public Harness API should directly execute tools without Guardian classification, approval, denial, or routing.

## Runtime Shape

LIMA Runtime is organized around these layers:

- Shells: Sparkbot, Arc / LIMA AI Office, SparkPit web, Robo shell, future robot shells
- System Services: skills, comms, voice, office automation, tasks/projects
- Spine: task/event/process ledger, schedulers, audit, lineage
- Guardian: policy, auth, vault, token/cost control, verifier, approvals, breakglass
- Model Harness: model routing, tool catalogue, tool-pack scoping, prompt cache, telemetry
- IO Drivers: Robo-OS, filesystem, browser, network, MCP servers, devices
- Persistence: one interface over SQLite, Postgres, Memory/Vault backends, future stores

## Extraction Rules

Contracts first.
Guardian always.
Sparkbot is the spec.
Extract, do not rewrite.
Robo-OS is a gated driver.
LIMA Runtime is the kernel.

Do not migrate implementation code until contracts are reviewed and accepted.
